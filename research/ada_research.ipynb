      "Task Decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This approach is particularly useful in the context of autonomous agents and large language models (LLMs). Here are some key points about Task Decomposition:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: This is a prompting technique that encourages the model to \"think step by step.\" By doing so, it can utilize more computational resources to decompose difficult tasks into simpler sub-tasks. This not only makes the tasks easier to handle but also provides insight into the model's reasoning process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tree of Thoughts**: An extension of CoT, this method explores multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It decomposes a problem into various thought steps and generates multiple thoughts for each step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be conducted using breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), with each state evaluated by a classifier or through majority voting.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Methods of Decomposition**: Task decomposition can be achieved through:\n",
      "   - Simple prompting (e.g., asking for steps to achieve a goal).\n",
      "   - Task-specific instructions (e.g., requesting a story outline for writing).\n",
      "   - Human inputs to guide the decomposition process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Execution**: After decomposition, expert models execute the specific tasks and log the results, allowing for a structured approach to complex problem-solving.\n",
